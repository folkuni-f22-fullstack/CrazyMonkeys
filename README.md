<h1 align="center">Funky Fusion, a project created by <i>Crazy Monkeys</i></h1>

The group, *Crazy Monkeys*, consists of Malin, Mustafa, Ali, Victor and Abbe.

Our teacher assigned us a project to create a fullstack web app for a hypothetical restaurant. The app should cater to the needs of customers, employees and chefs. We decided to design our app for a fusion restaurant, because we wanted to showcase our creativity and diversity.

Our frontend is based on *react*, a popular library for building user interfaces. We also used *react-router-dom* for navigation, *react-icons* for icons, and other dependencies such as *react-scroll* and *framer-motion*. Our code is mostly written in *JavaScript*, with some *TypeScript*.

We built our backend using *express*, a web framework for Node.js, and *mongoDB atlas*, a cloud database service. To enhance the security and performance of our backend, we also used *helmet*, a middleware that sets various HTTP headers, *morgan*, a logger that records the requests and responses, *mongoose*, an object data modeling library that simplifies working with mongoDB, and *nodemon*, a tool that automatically restarts the server when changes are detected.

The costumer role can browse the menu, search for information about the fake restaurant, and also do food orders that are sent to the employees, and after that to the chef. The costumer can write comments to the employees. When the order has come to the employee, the customer can edit the order to their liking, if they change their mind. When the order has come to the chef, the order can't be undone.  The employee role can see food order requests that the costumer has made. The employee can make messages to the chef when sending the order further to the chef.

Our project followed the scrum process, as instructed by our teacher, and we organized our tasks using *Trello* as a kanban board. We had daily *stand-ups*, *sprint reviews* and *sprint retrospective* and much communication. Every member of the group got the chance of being a *scrum master*.


<h2 align="center">Project Journey </h2>

In addition to the functional requirements, we applied the UX/UI design principles such as *Emphasize, Ideate, Prototype* and others. These principles helped us to understand the needs and preferences of the users, generate creative solutions, and test our prototypes with feedback. To guide our design process, we developed various *personas* that represent our target users and their needs.
